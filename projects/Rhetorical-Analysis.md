This essay was a rhetorical analysis essay about a chapter from a game I liked. More specifically the final boss' theme. I really quite enjoyed looking at the relationship described in the story and relating it to the lyrics. I fear that I did not quite go deep enough at the time, basically just recapping some story bits and associating them with the relevant lyrics. I have come to a few more epiphanies since them about how I could interpret the lyrics as it tells quite the sad story of two people who love each other so much, they are blinded by their own love that they cannot even begin to believe that they could be happier together, so they cut each other off so that overwhelming love turns into a deep burning sadness and hatred. As it was tailor made for the story, it of course fits well with the Wuthering Heights theme of the story chapter as it attempts to tell a tragic story between their versions of Heathcliff and Cathy. Such a heartwrenching tale of people breaking down from their inability to communicate. Makes me want to read the original Wuthering Heights some time.

It was nice letting my brain try to think over a story and how to interperet words and how they are conveyed, even if my view was tinted by the lens of my own existing feelings about the story. At any rate, this could serve as a little peak into how my brain works somewhat, and an exercise for me on how I could approach a topic from different angles to see what messages can be derived and interpreted, despite how little I actually did back then. On review though it is quite fun.
