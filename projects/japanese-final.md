For the final of my high school Japanese Class we had to make a presentation about a fictional product we created in Japanese. As it was my senior year, I was allowed to make a video that would be played for the class since we graduated a few weeks before the rest of the school finished out the school year. I didn't take this one too seriously and modeled it after a device from a show I liked. In fact a clip of what I was referencing is in the video itself.

In our modern day and age, video projects are becoming a lot more common, especially with certain recent events. Although the video isn't of the highest quality, it was still useful practice in working with video editing software and putting together a video, even if quite a barebones one. It was fun trying to be a little creative and figuring out at least a little bit how my supposed invention would work, even if I wasn't fully focused on making it realistic, especially since I had to work within the framework of my limited Japanese vocabulary.
